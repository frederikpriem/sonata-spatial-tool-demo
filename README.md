## Overview
This is a temporary repository for __demonstrating the SONATA spatial tool__ that is being developed in the frame of the HEU [__SONATA__](https://sonata-nbs.com/) project. The included notebook, test data and scripts illustrate the workings of the tool and allow performing small experiments with it.

Please note that the tool included here is still in an __experimental stage__ of development and is not yet deemed suitable for operational use. The code examples shown may not be representative for how the spatial tool will work once published.

Also note that the included source code is only a __partial and static copy of the original source code__. The full code base reflecting the current and previous versions of the SONATA spatial tool is hosted on the (not yet published) repository dedicated to this purpose.
